# Soesanto_CSCI2270_FinalProject
*/Contributor: Victoria Soesanto. 
*/Summary: For this project, i am planning to extend assignment 6 and 7 (movie tree assignment) and adding additional features, such as classes, binary trees, and functions. Since there are only a few options for the users in these assignments (it only includes find, rent, delete and count a movie, i want to add more options for the users, such as movie reccomendation according to what genre the users usually watched and also movie reccomendation based on ratings using trees.
